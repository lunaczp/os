This directory contains images of the 360K PC floppies which hold Minix 1.2.
These are archive disks created by Warren Toomey, by hand-patching Minix 1.1
with the USENET diffs for 1.2 posted by Andy Tanenbaum. As such, this is not
an official version of Minix 1.2 from Prentice-Hall. However, it is still
covered by the following copyright notice:

	MINIX BINARIES AND SOURCES FOR 640K IBM PC'S
